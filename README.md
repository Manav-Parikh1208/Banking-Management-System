Banking Management System  

The Banking Management System is a console-based application developed in C++ that allows users to perform essential banking operations. It enables users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, check balances, and manage account details. The program uses object-oriented programming and file handling to store and retrieve account data, ensuring data persistence even after the program is closed.  

Key Features  

- Account Creation: Users can create a new bank account with a unique account number.  
- Deposit Functionality: Users can deposit money into their account, with the balance updated accordingly.  
- Withdrawal with Validation: The system ensures that withdrawals do not exceed the available balance.  
- Balance Inquiry: Users can check their account balance and view account details.  
- Data Persistence: Account details are stored using file handling to retain data between program executions.  
- User-Friendly Interface: A simple menu-driven interface allows easy navigation and interaction.  
- Transaction Tracking: Displays transaction details, helping users keep track of their banking activity.  

How It Works  

1. Account Registration: Users enter their details to create a new account.  
2. Banking Operations: Users can deposit, withdraw, or check their balance using the menu options.  
3. File Storage: All account details are saved in a file for future reference.  
4. Data Retrieval: When the program runs again, it retrieves account information from the stored file.  

Conclusion  

The Banking Management System demonstrates how object-oriented programming and file handling can be used to develop a functional banking application. It provides a structured way to manage accounts, perform transactions, and store data persistently. This project serves as a great learning experience for beginners looking to understand C++ concepts in real-world applications. Future enhancements could include authentication, transaction history, and database integration to improve security and scalability.
